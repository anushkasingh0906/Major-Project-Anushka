1. ABSTRACT
This project presents a console-based Hangman game implemented in the C programming language.
The game randomly selects a secret word, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts. The system displays the progressively revealed word, remaining attempts, and win/loss outcomes. The project demonstrates the application of loops, arrays, conditional statements, string handling, and file operations to build an interactive game environment.
This project showcases practical implementation of core C programming concepts in an engaging and real-world-inspired problem scenario.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to apply structured programming techniques to design an interactive and logical word-guessing game using C. The goal is to enhance student understanding of:
Use of arrays and strings for text-based processing.
Function-based modular programming.
File handling for storing and selecting words.
Conditional logic and looping structures for game flow.
Menu-based console interface to simulate real application behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Games are widely used as learning tools and entertainment platforms. Hangman is a traditional word-guessing game where a player attempts to guess a hidden word with limited attempts.
Developing a console-based version of Hangman allows learning programming through practical implementation and without requiring graphical complexity.
The system should:
Select a word randomly from a file.
Accept player guesses one letter at a time.
Display correctly guessed letters and track remaining attempts.
Determine win or loss based on guesses.

------------------------------------------------------------

4. SYSTEM DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE
Project File Structure
|-- hangman.c
|-- words.txt
|-- functions.h

Major Components
Component	Description
hangman.c	Contains main function, menus, and game loop
functions.h	Function prototypes and global structure declarations
words.txt	Includes predefined list of words for random selection

------------------------------------------------------------

Program Flow
Load words from file.
Select a random word.
Display masked letters.
Accept a letter guess from the user.
Update status (correct/incorrect).
Continue until the word is complete or attempts reach zero.
Display final result and replay option.

------------------------------------------------------------

Flowchart
Start → Load Words → Select Random Word → Initialize Attempts
      ↓                    ↓
Display Hidden Word → Take Guess → Correct?
                          ↓Yes              ↓No
                     Update Display     Decrease Attempt
                          ↓                ↓
                  Win? → Yes Print Win   Attempts left?
                          ↓No                 ↓No
                        Continue        Print "Game Over"
                                    ↓
                                Replay? → End

------------------------------------------------------------

5. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Key C concepts used in the implementation:

• Arrays & Strings
Used to store and display the secret word and guessed letters.

• File Handling
Loads word list using:
FILE *file = fopen("words.txt", "r");

• Loops & Conditionals
Used to update game logic and validate guesses.

• Functions
Improved readability & modularity

------------------------------------------------------------

Sample Code Snippet (Guess Processing)
int correctGuess = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < strlen(secretWord); i++) {
    if(secretWord[i] == guessLetter) {
        display[i] = guessLetter;
        correctGuess = 1;
    }
}

if(!correctGuess) {
    attempts--;
    printf("Wrong guess! Attempts left: %d\n", attempts);
}

------------------------------------------------------------

6. TESTING & RESULTS
Test Case	Input	Expected Output	Result
Correct letter	a	Reveals positions in word	Passed
Wrong letter	z	Attempts decrease	Passed
Word fully guessed	_ _ _ a _	Win screen	Passed
No attempts left	—	Loss screen	Passed
Example Output
Welcome to Hangman!
Word: _ _ _ _ _ _
Enter a letter: a
Correct guess!
Word: a _ _ _ _ _
Attempts remaining: 5
…
Congratulations! You guessed the word!

------------------------------------------------------------

7. CONCLUSION
The Hangman game project successfully demonstrates the use of C language fundamentals in building an interactive game environment. Through this project, essential programming skills such as file handling, string manipulation, loops, and modular design were practiced. The project can be extended by adding features such as scoring system, levels of difficulty, or graphical interface using OpenGL or ncurses library.

------------------------------------------------------------

8. FUTURE SCOPE
Add different difficulty levels and hint system
Save player high scores
Support multiplayer mode
Convert to GUI-based desktop application
